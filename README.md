The Notes App is a command-line application that allows you to manage notes. It has four main features: adding a note, listing all notes, updating a note, and deleting a note. To use the app, simply run the main function in the NoteKeeper.kt file. Once the app is running, select an option from the menu by entering the corresponding number and pressing enter. To exit the application, select option 0.
